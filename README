This is personal gentoo overlay of Petr Mor√°vek [Xificurk].
It contains various ebuilds missing in official portage tree,
that I gathered from sources like bugs.gentoo.org, developer's
overlays, or written myself ;-)

If you want to use this overlay, you need to:

1) Install layman:
     # emerge layman
2) Add my overlay list to /etc/layman/layman.cfg - find the "overlays"
   directive and add URL:
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xificurk/xificurk-gentoo-overlay/master/xificurk-overlay.xml
3) Fetch the overlay list:
     # layman -L
4) Add my overlay:
     # layman -a xificurk
