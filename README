This is personal gentoo overlay of Petr Morávek [Xificurk].
It contains various ebuilds missing in official portage tree,
that I gathered from sources like bugs.gentoo.org, developer's
overlays, or written myself ;-)

If you want to use this overlay, you need to:

1) Install layman:
     # emerge layman
2) Add my overlay list to /etc/layman/layman.cfg - find the "overlays"
   directive and add URL:
     https://github.com/xificurk/xificurk-gentoo-overlay/raw/master/xificurk-overlay.xml
3) Fetch the overlay list:
     # layman -L
4) Add my overlay:
     # layman -a xificurk
5) To sync overlay either use manually:
     # layman -S
   Or you can sync portage and all your overlays with eix-sync (from eix package), you
   need to configure eix with:
     # echo "*" >> /etc/eix-sync.conf
